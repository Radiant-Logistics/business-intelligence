This repo contains the script that was generated out of Power Query.
We created a report for one of our stations and it now works so we will be saving the script here and if we ever encounter a similar report request for a different station, then we'll be happy to help them set their report.
At the moment, we are still relying on the data that is generated out of BOBJ. With that said we will still generate the reports from BOBJ, use the Excel file as basis for our scripting on PQ, and provide the station access to their own report.
